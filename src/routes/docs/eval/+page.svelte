<h1>Evaluation of Papers</h1>

<p>
The workshop will accept both regular papers and short papers (work in progress, vision/outrageous ideas).
The page limit for regular papers is 6 pages, and for short papers is 4 pages with unlimited references. 
The papers will be uploaded as PDF files to the review system. Each paper will be reviewed by at least three reviewers from the program committee (PC).
We will apply the same principles for handling conflicts of interest with PC members or workshop chairs at the ICDE conference.
We plan to invite a diverse, world-class program committee of about 10-15 experts in the domains of data management and engineering, data science, quantum information and quantum computing, and quantum machine learning.
